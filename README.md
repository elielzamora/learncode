# learncode
Demonstrating my ability to code various algorithms, data structures and beyond in the realm computer science

## Ideally the idea was as follows

##Consits of:
- Datastrure
  - stack
  - queue
  - list
  - dictionary
- Algorithms
  - graph
  - sort 
  - greedy
- Machine Learning
  - ANN
    -RNN
    -Backpropagation

### And so much more to come!!!

## But clearly this was too cumbersome served no purpose and was way too bloated

My goal to demonstrate my 'coding' abilities will be transfered to more focused and concrete problems and/or projects

e.g. ML in its own repo
e.g. graphing algorithms in its own repo

and as things progress in each a more specialized repo for each project will emerge.

For example one Idea that comes to mind is that eventually I'll have a project for ANNs in one repo seperate from ML or what-be-it.
